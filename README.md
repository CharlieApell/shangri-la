## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion

Shangri-La is a yoga place in Norrk√∂ping, Sweden. The website is built so that the user can read about the yoga place on different devices and hopefully become interested and send an email about questions or membership.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

* To be able to view the site on a range of different device sizes.
* To make it easy for potential members to find out what Yoga is and how to take part.
* To allow people to be able to contact the Yoga Place to ask further questions.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to find out what is Shangri-La Yoga and how I can take part of it.
* I want to be able to navigate the site easily to find information.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* I want to ask a question.
* I want to know when the next yoga lesson is.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

I chose to work with colors that are earthy for my website because "mother nature" and Yoga go hand in hand, therefore I chose colors that went in the slightly golden/brown to more off white and black.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.
Montez for the logo and Latos for everything else.

### Imagery

I have used stock photos from https://unsplash.com/ from different yoga places around the world

### Wireframes

![Wireframe pp1](documentation/Wireframe-pp1.png)
I wanted to do a scroll down menu when browsing on either a tablet or phone but i didn't have the time to make it work,
so I settled for a simpler approach and placed the menu below the logo when browsing on a phone or tablet.

## Features

The website consists of five pages, with four pages available through the navigation menu (home page, about us page, gallery page and contact page). The fifth page, which provides information about Kids Yoga, can be accessed from either the schedule on the home page or the about us page.

## General features on each page

### All Pages on the website have:
* A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is the text Shangri-La. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, about us, gallery and contact). When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a smaller text placed under the text "Shangri-La", from the beginning i wanted a burger icon but uunfortunately i was running out of time.
* A footer containg the adress, a map and links to Shangri-La's social media pages.

### Home page
* Hero image from unsplash with a zoom animation to capture the users attention

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
